## About Me

I'm a PhD Candidate at [Probabilistic Machine Learning group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/), [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/en/), working with Pekka Marttinen and Samuel Kaski. I'm interested in probabilistic modeling, inference, deep learning, bioinformatics, and many more things.

I got my MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), and BSc in Statistics from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/).  I have worked in Invenia Lab, Cambridge with Francesco Caravelli, and Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences with Mingxue Liao.
