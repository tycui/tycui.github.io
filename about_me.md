## About Me

I'm a PhD Candidate at [Probabilistic Machine Learning group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/), [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/en/), working with Pekka Marttinen and Samuel Kaski. I'm interested in probabilistic modeling, inference, deep learning, bioinformatics, and many more things.
