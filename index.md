# Biography
Tianyu Cui is a research associate in machine learning at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), and he is also a visiting researcher at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). He read his Ph.D. in [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) and [Machine Learning for Health (ML4H)](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/~pemartti/) at [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/en/), with Prof. [Samuel Kaski](https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski) and Prof. [Pekka Marttinen](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/~pemartti/). He earned his M.Sc. in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and B.Sc. in Statistics from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/). 

His research interests are in deep learning and Bayesian modelling, with a particular interest in probabilistic methods for biomedical applications, such as genetics and [complex diseases](https://ukdri.ac.uk/). He has acted as a program committee member/reviewer for, e.g., AABI, AISTATS, ICML, and JMLR.
